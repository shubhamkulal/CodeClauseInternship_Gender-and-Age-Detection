# Gender and Age Detection Project

## Overview

This repository contains code for a Gender and Age Detection project using machine learning. The project aims to predict the gender and age of individuals from facial images. By utilizing a dataset of facial images CSV, the project provides insights into automatic gender and age estimation.

## Dataset

The project employs the "age_gender.csv" dataset for model training and evaluation. The dataset comprises the following features:

- `age`: The age of the individual.
- `gender`: The gender of the individual.
- `pixels`: Pixel values representing the facial image.

## Analysis

The project encompasses the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The facial image data is preprocessed, including resizing and normalization, to prepare it for model input.

2. **Model Training**: Separate models are trained for gender and age prediction using deep learning techniques.

3. **Evaluation**: The trained models are evaluated using appropriate metrics to assess their accuracy and performance.

4. **Visualization**: Results are visualized through scatter plots and graphs to demonstrate the model's predictive capabilities.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to replicate the project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/shubhamkulal/CodeClauseInternship_Gender-and-Age-Detection.git`.

2. Install required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. Place the "age_gender.csv" dataset in the appropriate location (e.g., `data/age_gender.csv`).

4. Modify hyperparameters or paths as needed in the project files.

5. Run the training scripts for gender and age models using `python train_gender_model.py` and `python train_age_model.py`.

6. Evaluate the models with `python evaluate_models.py`.

7. Visualize the results using `python visualize_results.py`.
